## This folder is for the projects requirement specification and analysis

# What is Requirement Analysis?

 Requirement analysis is the process of understanding what the software does, what is expected from the software after it is completed.
 It is the process of determining user expectations.
 # Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
 -It helps us understand the scope of the project and allows us to allocate resources efficiently.
 -Reduces Costs and Time
 -It Improves product quality
 # Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
**Requirement Gathering
This involves collecting initial information about what stakeholders need from the system. It lays the foundation for understanding project goals and scope.

**Requirement Elicitation
Elicitation focuses on actively engaging with stakeholders to draw out detailed, often unspoken, needs through techniques like interviews and surveys.

**Requirement Documentation
All gathered and elicited requirements are clearly written down to ensure shared understanding among team members and stakeholders.

**Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Requirements are examined for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, often represented using models like use case diagrams or data flow diagrams.

**Requirement Validation
This ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible within project constraints.

# Types of Requirements

## 1. Functional Requirements
- **Definition**: Functional requirements define what the system should do — the features and behaviors.
- **Examples**:
  - Users can create, modify, and cancel bookings.
  - The system sends email confirmations after successful bookings.
  - Admins can approve or reject pending booking requests.
## 2. Non-functional Requirements
- **Definition**: Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs — qualities, constraints, or attributes.
- **Examples**:
  - The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
  - The platform must be available 99.9% of the time.
  - Booking data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
