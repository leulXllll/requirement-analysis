 # Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
**Requirement Gathering
This involves collecting initial information about what stakeholders need from the system. It lays the foundation for understanding project goals and scope.

**Requirement Elicitation
Elicitation focuses on actively engaging with stakeholders to draw out detailed, often unspoken, needs through techniques like interviews and surveys.

**Requirement Documentation
All gathered and elicited requirements are clearly written down to ensure shared understanding among team members and stakeholders.

**Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Requirements are examined for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, often represented using models like use case diagrams or data flow diagrams.

**Requirement Validation
This ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible within project constraints.
